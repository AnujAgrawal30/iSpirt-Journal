        Research.iSPIRT attempts to systematically integrate the accumulated knowledge and working experience of the
        organization with contemporary scholarship and policy formulation. India has built an array of Application
        Programming Interfaces (APIs) that serve as base infrastructure for digitalizing traditional sectors of the
        economy; anchor value generation from the digital economy in practices that are not driven by the ability to
        capture and hoard data; and configure, as a result, new institutional arrangements between the state and the
        private sector in the provision of civic services. This is an ambitious undertaking, complicated by the fact
        that there are few prescriptive theories for the development or deployment of such technologies, or
        analytical frameworks to evaluate their consequences.

        In its capacity as a non-profit think tank, iSPIRT has helped develop and evangelise many of these APIs. The
        iterative process of forging ‘first-mover’ coalitions of public and private entities to scale the
        implementation of APIs, and working with independent regulators to secure their confidence and approval, has
        offered iSPIRT a ringside view of how government and market interact with such technologies. The adoption of
        these APIs – through user-facing apps – by Indian citizens has also gathered pace in recent years. Successes
        and failures in API development, implementation, and roll-out offer a body of evidence that can chart future
        policies as well as guide academic engagement. The working papers/publications in this portal do not
        retrofit a grand theory into the creation of APIs and attendant ecosystems. They offer inductive frameworks
        that could shape policies in India, as well as other jurisdictions that may want to emulate the “India
        Stack” model.
