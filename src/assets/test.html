<h1 id="the_problem">The Problem<a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h1>


<p>
Nearly three decades after Silicon Valley surfed a wave of globalisation to tap foreign markets, its role and legacy in modernising societies remains chequered. It is widely acknowledged the Valley’s start-ups have not been able to meet the high standard they set for themselves — solve the world’s problems using technology.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Save a few notable exceptions, the pernicious model of advertisement-generated revenue appears to have become Silicon Valley’s mainstay today.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The Covid-19 pandemic has elevated the importance of technology platforms to everyday lives, with some suggesting companies like Amazon and Zoom be treated as public utilities.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> However important they may be to our present moment and changes in lifestyle, it is difficult to refashion -- except by blunt regulatory fiat<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> -- existing technology corporations into purveyors of “digital public goods”. This is perhaps why a veteran entrepreneur like Marc Andreessen recently asked his peers to train their vision towards “housing, healthcare and education”, and “build” solutions anew.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The question remains: sans systemic and regulatory changes across jurisdictions, can technology platforms be cast in a mould different from the one they are currently in?  
</p>
<p>
Most technology platforms still treat users as data points, leading markets to value their businesses on the basis of engagement or acquisition metrics.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> These platforms may enhance productivity in some cases, but lend themselves towards monopolisation, because their eventual aim is to corner the most number of users. The “race to the top” for eyeballs and fingertips generates in turn another race: one for domination of the underlying infrastructure upon which platforms are built.
</p>
<p>
For instance, a mobile app has a head start over its competitors if its developer also owns the operating system, and even the handheld device, for which said app is developed. To illustrate, Google seeks preferential placement of its own search engine and other Google apps on the home screen of device manufacturers that run on the Android OS.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> This practice has invited the recent scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Google’s developer policy ensures, by defining those categories of data that can and cannot be collected by phones and third-party apps (say, biometric information, or access to the phone’s camera), that their ‘guidelines’ become <em>de</em> <em>facto</em> standards on data collection in digital economies, especially ones that do not have comprehensive or granular data protection laws.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> The “stick” for the enforcement of such guidelines is of course the market dominance Android enjoys among mobile devices. 
</p>
<p>
Technology companies have few incentives to pull away from “winner-takes-all” races, especially if they have a head start. Apple generates a staggering profit margin of nearly 40% on every device it manufactures, on account of its tight grip over the physical ICT supply chain, which is reinforced by the iPhone’s popularity and market share, and <em>vice</em> <em>versa</em>.<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Its market share also allows Apple, as with the case of Android/Google, Facebook and other big platforms, to ‘hard wire’ desired data protection standards into economies<sup id="fnref10"><a href="#fn10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> — which in turn boosts the prospects of their continued success. Thus, the formulaic “Big Tech” company is born. The penal costs of anti-competitive activity, running into a few billion dollars, does not in any way affect seriously their business models. <sup id="fnref11"><a href="#fn11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
These vicious cycles have in the past been defended as consequences of “economies of scale” and “network effects”<sup id="fnref12"><a href="#fn12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. More recently, they have prompted calls for a more “integrated” approach to regulation, that takes into account the “complexity of ownership relations, governance, and technical interrelations” across the ecosystem that platforms straddle.<sup id="fnref13"><a href="#fn13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> By limiting platform interoperability, straitjacketing consumer choices, and following predatory practices over the downstream supply chain, Big Tech not only creates market inefficiencies, but also incubates socio-economic inequality. Yet, in a world afflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, it is apparent that the consequences of “platformization” will no longer be confined to the digital realm. Technology platforms aim now to solve “old” or “real world” problems with technology. If traditional supply chains in retail, transportation, health or education were to be similarly cannibalised or walled off by Big Tech, it would spell disaster to economies and livelihoods. The need to correct course from political economy structures that facilitate the easy capture of markets has therefore acquired greater urgency.
</p>
<h1 id="from_tech_to_traditional">From Tech to Traditional<a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h1>


<p>
Is the monopolisation of traditional sectors by Big Tech a misplaced concern? Can Google or Apple really come to determine say, the education curriculum or bus fares in countries like India? One can already see this in motion, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic. For instance, Apple and Google have come together to offer a contact tracing API (Application Programming Interface) that may be adopted by millions of smartphone users worldwide, instantly conferring legitimacy of their presence in digitalized healthcare systems.<sup id="fnref14"><a href="#fn14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> Already, they have influenced policy choices through their combined monopoly in the “winner-take-all” market of contact-tracing: by determining the API would be available only to “one app per country”<sup id="fnref15"><a href="#fn15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> -- preferably governments -- they have ring-fenced their innovation from competition and regulatory scrutiny, while ensuring unimpeded access to new markets. Similarly, Facebook and other Silicon Valley businesses have long been eyeing investments in “EdTech”. With the Covid-19 pandemic making distance-learning a necessity, it is likely that those EdTech innovations backed by technology companies with ready access to a captive digital market will thrive at the cost of smaller players.
</p>
<p>
The lack of regulatory institutions, or even frameworks, to address this problem of technology’s “spillover” into traditional institutions definitely lends cause for concern for developing nations such as India. Big Tech engages in regulatory arbitrage: on the one hand, technology companies exploit the dominant narrative that the public sector is simply too bureaucratic or not nimble enough to facilitate digital innovation.<sup id="fnref16"><a href="#fn16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> Therefore, the argument goes, “sunrise” sectors should be lightly regulated. On the other, they also take advantage of the fact that, once established, regulations in former license-driven economies usually favour incumbents through barriers to entry and exit, thus avoiding public scrutiny as they expand control over supply chains and markets.
</p>
<p>
This same strategy of benign “disruption” can conceivably be deployed in traditional sectors of the economy — especially a government-dominated one like India’s and other emerging markets — where regulations on infrastructure, education, health and other “public goods” evolve at a glacial pace. The contact-tracing app developed by Google and Apple is one example. Companies like WeWork or Uber, whose businesses resemble traditional real-estate agencies and taxi operators respectively, position themselves as technology companies, giving themselves room to engage in anti-competitive behavior under the mantle of “innovation”. In reality, “capital is the competitive weapon”<sup id="fnref17"><a href="#fn17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup> for these businesses, whose products may not be the most innovative, but rely on deep pockets to corner markets.  The lack of a cogent and consistent framework to govern digital platforms is therefore primed for exploitation in sectors that may have hitherto seen little or no technological interventions.  
</p>
<p>
In some domains, the consequences of this shift from “tech to traditional” are already visible. Take a high-value sector, one involving the production and dissemination of knowledge: publishing. Amazon and other big e-retailers mark down prices of books, often through algorithmic determination of their perceived popularity or future prospects. The author may continue to receive royalties on the MRP negotiated with her publisher, but the subsidising of low book prices comes at the cost of revenue for the publishing company and small book sellers. Even third-party sellers that offer books on Amazon are forced to conform to the requirements set by the platform. Naturally, these developments are debilitating for a fraught sector in economies like India but have long been justified as benefiting the end user (i.e., the reader). Just as proprietary platforms have sought to capture higher positions in the value chain with FMCG goods (e.g. Amazon Basics or Amazon Elements), they have also sought to control all aspects of high-value sectors. Through Kindle and Audible, Amazon is able to exercise powerful levers on selection of published content. Audible introducing captions through machine learning software prompted a lawsuit in July 2019 against Amazon for cannibalising copyrighted content, and leaving few incentives for readers to buy books. Amazon was pitted against the “Big Five” of publishing in this instance, yet managed to stave off litigation.<sup id="fnref18"><a href="#fn18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Policymakers are sensitive to the problem of vertical monopolies and are clamouring to “break up” Big Tech. However, states seek reflexively to regulate these platforms for their market share, measured largely by footfall. Such attempts at regulation reach a dead end, usually manifesting as plain-vanilla, anti-monopoly prescriptions. As mentioned previously, the EU’s imposing what it perceives to be punitive costs on Google for anti-competitive practices in advertising neither affects the company’s domination of the EU digital market nor prompts a change in its data collection methods. In any event, the so-called “Brussels Effect”<sup id="fnref19"><a href="#fn19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> appears to be on the wane at the time of writing this paper, challenged even from within.<sup id="fnref20"><a href="#fn20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Regulation of technology platforms is certainly necessary, but “banner” penalties like structural segregation or billion-dollar fines do little to remedy the underlying problem. Imagine if Indian regulators were to levy hefty fines on Big Tech, a la, the European Commission. Business models of technology companies and the extant frameworks to govern them do not meaningfully interact with the vast majority of internet users in the world, including in India, who are excluded from formal economies, and thus have no way of being beneficiaries of services, either directly or through pecuniary compensation generated from regulatory action. Take for instance, the problem of providing liquidity to small businesses in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has agitated policymakers in both advanced economies and emerging markets. In countries like India, most of these businesses are invisible to the government -- outside the purview of the goods and services tax network, with no formal payroll mechanism to speak of.<sup id="fnref21"><a href="#fn21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> In formalised economies such as the United States, the problem is elsewhere: there is no common technology platform that can effectively disburse small business loans on top of a highly fragmented banking infrastructure.<sup id="fnref22"><a href="#fn22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup> In both cases, banks will lend to those entities it trusts, usually on the basis of asset records -- medium-sized enterprises or big businesses that control the supply chain -- either as final beneficiaries or as intermediaries to disburse financial support downstream. The breaking up of e-retailers or Big Tech in other sectors can conceivably worsen the situation in this case! 
</p>
<p>
It is therefore important to create both digital public goods and “playgrounds” that facilitate the inclusion of small businesses, startups and ordinary users into the formal economy. Equally critical is to ensure that these actors are not locked in a relationship of dependency with bigger, more powerful businesses in the playground. Big platforms can certainly enjoin these “playgrounds”, but their potentially dominant behavior will be preempted by “rules of the playground”, designed through technical and institutional measures. In India, these digital railroads are already being built, and the Covid-19 pandemic may witness the creation of the country’s first playgrounds in the health and lending sectors. In sum, playgrounds and DPGs necessitate a re-imagining of policy/ regulatory structures. This paper -- the first in a series of working papers to flesh out the contours of such structures -- offers a framework to understand and envision digital public goods and technology “playgrounds”. It reviews the theoretical literature on Big Tech regulation, and identifies key assumptions, as well as inadequacies. The paper concludes with a case study: that of the history and evolution of the global playground for online travel, and lessons for regulators and entrepreneurs from its imperfect design.

<h1 id="digital_public">Digital Public Goods: Theoretical Framework and Illustrations<a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h1>


<p>
DPGs, as the term suggests, represent the digital variant of non-excludable and non-rivalrous public goods. The government of Norway, for e.g., defines DPGs as “technologies and content with licensing and design which makes it possible to scale widely, in different contexts, and be adapted for contextual needs”, categorizing them as software, standards or data.<sup id="fnref23"><a href="#fn23" rel="footnote">23</a></sup> In July 2018,  the UN Secretary-General tasked a High Level Panel to examine “digital cooperation”, <em>i.e.</em>, “ways to work together to address the social, ethical, legal and economic impact of digital technologies in order to maximise their benefits and minimise their harm.”<sup id="fnref24"><a href="#fn24" rel="footnote">24</a></sup> The panel, whose report the following year also explored how digital technologies may help fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals, defined DPGs as “types of digital technologies and content – from data to apps, data visualisation tools to educational curricula – that are [...] freely and openly available, with minimal restrictions on how they can be distributed, adapted and reused.”<sup id="fnref25"><a href="#fn25" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> In the context of this working paper, DPGs refer to protocols (a collection of APIs) that facilitate any number of innovations, but need to be ring-fenced by technical and institutional rules to prevent their monopolistic capture or use. Digital Public Goods are the nuclei around which “playgrounds” -- actors who tap into the DPG, rules of conduct for those actors, and institutions to implement those rules -- develop. 
</p>
<p>
As with their traditional counterparts, digital public goods too can be viewed as “pure” and “impure”, indicating some technologies may not be fully non-excludable or non-rivalrous. The institutional architecture by which the “impurity” in public goods provision is addressed is of great socio-economic consequence. Without adequate institutional protections, a public good is susceptible to capture, which is true for DPGs and technology platforms as well. For e.g. common pool resources, which are non-excludable but are exhaustible and vulnerable to over-exploitation<sup id="fnref26"><a href="#fn26" rel="footnote">26</a></sup> -- a problem described as the Tragedy of the Commons -- need a rule-bound framework to ensure they are not depleted to the detriment of everyone.<sup id="fnref27"><a href="#fn27" rel="footnote">27</a></sup> This framework is applied frequently to natural resources, especially the governance of high seas, outer space, and greenhouse gas emissions. 
</p>
<p>
Digital technologies can be framed as “impure” public goods in two ways. The ring-fencing of platforms through Intellectual Property Rights can restrict the use of software by ordinary users, making it excludable. “Open source” software, which stands in contrast to proprietary ones, has been described as a private provision of a public good<sup id="fnref28"><a href="#fn28" rel="footnote">28</a></sup>. OS software usually has licensing restrictions attached to it that outline -- in the Ostrom<em>ian</em> sense -- the rights of the developer as well as attendant responsibilities to make it available to others.<sup id="fnref29"><a href="#fn29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup> However, open sourcing code is no guarantee of an optimal distribution of benefits from the public good. The licensee’s underlying control over markets or supply chains, as discussed in the earlier segment of the paper, can give its products an instant advantage over competition. Android’s success is a good example of how Google has brought to bear its monopolistic hold on other dimensions of the handheld device market -- search engine, Maps APIs, as well as its role as the gatekeeper of the Google Play store -- to continually reinforce the Operating System’s adoption. Tesla famously opened its Electric Vehicle patents in 2014 to any one who wanted to use them “in good faith”<sup id="fnref30"><a href="#fn30" rel="footnote">30</a></sup> -- this was a strategic move to guide the development of EV (including charging) standards, in the garb of open source technology. As a result, competitors like Toyota lost out in the hybrid segment, belatedly offering their patents for free -- to little consequence.<sup id="fnref31"><a href="#fn31" rel="footnote">31</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
A second way in which digital public goods could end up being excludable is through the physical infrastructure that sustains them. The lack of network capacity or affordable internet connections are good reasons why this may occur. Zero-rated digital platforms are another example of “club goods” that limit access to the internet by creating “walled gardens”, and there is some evidence to suggest they increase broadband costs as well.<sup id="fnref32"><a href="#fn32" rel="footnote">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Economists and political theorists concur public goods can be further classified into “summation/additive”, “best-shot” and “weak link” technologies. With summation technologies, each individual contribution creates an additive effect to the overall supply of the public good (e.g., curbs on greenhouse gas emissions). “Weak link” technologies, as the name suggests, are those where the public good supplied is only as effective as the smallest contribution (e.g. cybersecurity, surveillance of epidemics). And best-shot technologies are those in which the reverse is true, and the biggest contribution steers the overall supply of the public good (e.g. vaccine R&D, Global Positioning System<sup id="fnref33"><a href="#fn33" rel="footnote">33</a></sup>). The table below -- offered by political scientist Todd Sandler -- offers examples of different kinds of public goods. 
</p>
<p>
Naturally, all DPGs cannot be shoehorned into a single type of “technology”, and whether they are “additive”, “weak link” or “best-shot”, will depend on the sector in question. This is an agenda for future research by students of India’s digital economy. Digital standards generally (but not always) fit the definition of “best shot” public goods. However, as the example of open source software underlines, they are easily susceptible to market capture. Until May 2000, the United States enforced a policy of “selective availability”, intentionally degrading the quality of its GPS signals for certain use cases on account of national security.<sup id="fnref34"><a href="#fn34" rel="footnote">34</a></sup> The decision to block military-grade GPS signals to India during the Kargil War in 1999 purportedly led India to develop its own GPS system, NavIC.<sup id="fnref35"><a href="#fn35" rel="footnote">35</a></sup> This is an “inefficient” outcome in a Pareto framework. Similarly, non-digital considerations can affect the supply of a DPG. For e.g., consider the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as a DPG that “supplies” the good of greater financial inclusion and faster banking transactions. The recent crisis of liquidity that affected Yes Bank -- leading to a moratorium on withdrawals imposed by the Reserve Bank of India  -- hindered the supply of this public good. Nearly 40% of monthly UPI transactions were attributed to Yes Bank handles, on account of the bank being an early adopter of UPI and having a head start in partnering with downstream wallets such as PhonePe. The bank’s crisis therefore affected the DPG secularly, becoming a “weak link” in the chain. It illustrates the need to build resilience in a “playground” to ensure smooth supply of a public good.<sup id="fnref36"><a href="#fn36" rel="footnote">36</a></sup>

<h1 id="who_would_supply">Who should supply Digital Public Goods?<a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h1>


<p>
Approaches to technological innovation and theories on the efficient provision of public goods are closely linked: it is today acknowledged that digital innovation is not ceaseless or permissionless, but depends on openness -- levels of access to, and interoperability -- of underlying platforms.<sup id="fnref37"><a href="#fn37" rel="footnote">37</a></sup> Yet, the idea that Silicon Valley companies continue to thrive on such innovation has remarkably persisted for years. Dotson argues the notion of permissionless innovation is “undergirded by an assumption that the benefits of innovation are (near) universally distributed and that the harms are relatively insignificant [...] it mobilizes bias for the benefit of a select population of consumers, innovators, and large tech firms.”<sup id="fnref38"><a href="#fn38" rel="footnote">38</a></sup> The conceptualisation of APIs as digital public goods is fairly recent, but the marriage of innovation theories and those on public goods provision is only a matter of time. This segment highlights the traditional economic thinking that has hitherto underpinned the governance of digital technologies, and the main challenges to such views.
</p>
<p>
Digital technologies have long been characterised as conforming closely to the Schumpeterian model of “creative destruction”. Joseph Schumpeter, in his seminal 1942 treatise <em>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em>, wrote:
</p>
<p>

    <em>The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrates [sic] the same process of industrial mutation — if I may use that biological term — that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. </em><sup id="fnref39"><a href="#fn39" rel="footnote">39</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Schumpeter situated this process at the heart of business cycles in a capitalist economy, and acknowledged it may lead to the rise of monopolistic or oligopolistic forces. In 2000, just as the dot-com bubble crossed its inflection point, then Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers famously declared the “new economy” to be a Schumpeterian one. “The only incentive to produce anything is the possession of temporary monopoly power [... and its constant pursuit becomes] the central driving thrust of the new economy,” he said at a Silicon Valley conference.<sup id="fnref40"><a href="#fn40" rel="footnote">40</a></sup> “And the creative destruction that results from all that striving becomes the essential spur of economic growth. In that sense, if the agricultural and industrial economies were Smithian - the new economy is Schumpeterian.” Summers offered another analogy that mirrored Schumpeter’s “mutation” metaphor. He referred to the traditional economic structures as “Newtonian” -- responding to the action and reaction of supply and demand, requiring only prices to be calibrated -- and the new one to be “Darwinian”, where the fittest would survive and the winner would take all.<sup id="fnref41"><a href="#fn41" rel="footnote">41</a></sup> In both assessments, the objective was deregulation, in the faith that technology markets would correct themselves, and defeat so-called temporary monopolies. 
</p>
<p>
The view that technology markets would offer “positive feedback”, and not necessarily conform to the law of diminishing marginal returns was developed well before Summers articulated it in the summer of 2000. In fact, the economic theory on “path dependence” and “increasing returns” grew out of, and coincided, with the rise of Silicon Valley through the eighties and nineties. Paul A. David’s watershed 1985 article in the <em>American Economic Review </em>held up the example of the QWERTY keyboard to argue “the process of intersystem competition [in technology markets tended] to lead towards de facto standardization”<sup id="fnref42"><a href="#fn42" rel="footnote">42</a></sup>. The year Netscape browser hit the market, Santa Fe Institute’s Brian Arthur suggested “players compete not by locking in a product on their own but by building <em>webs — </em>loose alliances of companies organized around a mini-ecology — that amplify positive feedback to the base technology.”<sup id="fnref43"><a href="#fn43" rel="footnote">43</a></sup> Given the dominance of a certain platform or company that would ensue, Arthur argued, it was important to choose which partners to build upon.<sup id="fnref44"><a href="#fn44" rel="footnote">44</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In later iterations, Arthur suggested the creation of new technologies -- “innovation”, as it were -- did not exactly respond to a Darwinian framework. Instead, they evolve in a “combinatorial” manner, interacting with the economy and responding to its needs, rather than presenting themselves as a bolt from the blue. <sup id="fnref45"><a href="#fn45" rel="footnote">45</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) have been held up as one such example of a combinatorial digital technology, which sets the stage for innovations that have increasing returns.<sup id="fnref46"><a href="#fn46" rel="footnote">46</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
The combinatorial possibilities of digital public goods, however, only reinforce the question: who should supply them? If private corporations have curtailed downstream innovation, should it be the responsibility of the state to supply the digital public good? Or can the state and private sector work in concert, to ensure the private provision of DPGs is subject to “playground” rules that enforce accountability?
</p>
<p>
The pushback to the conventional view on innovation has brought the state back into regulatory discourse. In 2011, the economist Mariana Mazzucato published “The Entrepreneurial State” -- submitted first as a pamphlet to the British think tank Demos, it was later printed as a book.<sup id="fnref47"><a href="#fn47" rel="footnote">47</a></sup> Mazzucato broke down four important theses (“myths”) that animate the conventional perception of innovation among entrepreneurs and policymakers alike. Her assessment highlights the important role of the government in catalysing innovation, but this paper distils them into lessons for DPGs and playgrounds built around them.
</p>
<p>
<em>First, </em>Mazzucato argued, R&D alone will not catalyse innovation and economic growth. R&D cannot be general purpose, but “mission-oriented” because business cycles and firm attributes in most sectors (health, education, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture etc) tend to be radically different from each other. What is needed is “a better division of labour between universities and companies, where universities should focus on high-level research and firms on technology development.”<sup id="fnref48"><a href="#fn48" rel="footnote">48</a></sup> DARPA and NASA curate two mission-oriented technology “playgrounds”, but perhaps their successes may only be replicated if the curator has sufficient autonomy from both state and market: helping it foster targeted R&D, but also ensuring its commercial deployment is not captured by one or two market players. Can this “mission-orientation” come from industrial policies?
</p>
<p>
<em>Second</em>, Mazzacuto argues the notion that “small is beautiful”, which has been the driving philosophy for most Silicon Valley startups, does not always bear out in the market. Most startup innovation in Silicon Valley today is marginal, and feeds into greater platformization by FAANG companies.  “Productivity should be the focus”, Mazzacuto argues, which is not often the forté of small firms.<sup id="fnref49"><a href="#fn49" rel="footnote">49</a></sup> The problem may not be big technology companies <em>per se,</em> but dependencies they induce by restrictions on data mobility, or discriminatory treatment of small businesses on their platforms. Those restrictions hamper innovation by small firms.
</p>
<p>
<em>Third</em>, <em>The Entrepreneurial State</em> debunks the view that venture capital is risk-taking. Mazzacuto positions VCs as intermediaries: supporting a technology whose foundation is any way held up by basic research on the one end, and whose market entry or deployment at-scale is propped up by larger private equity firms on the other. The phase in the middle is usually a low-risk activity, in comparison to the processes bookending it. As a result, venture capital suffers from a self-selection problem, drifting towards areas that are “high potential growth” and ignoring societal needs. VC has worked, she argues, “[when committed finance is backed by] managerial expertise, and ensures the building of a viable organisation.”<sup id="fnref50"><a href="#fn50" rel="footnote">50</a></sup> Playgrounds must not only identify the actors involved in the creation of a DPG, but also frame their respective roles vis-a-vis investments. Should governments continue incubating basic research, through national science complexes that have emerged across the world after WWII? Should venture capital be conceived still as an intermediary, or can it leverage playground partnerships to scale up market deployment of basic research? In other words, can playgrounds re-align venture capital’s goals in a way that addresses their risk appetite, but moves the needle on socially relevant digital innovation?
</p>
<p>
<em>Fourth</em>, Mazzacuto bluntly states patents “do not equal” progress in innovation. In the ten years since the monograph’s publication, this view has steadily gained momentum and will likely reach a crescendo after the Covid-19 pandemic recedes. Patents, Mazzacuto argues, “cause the rate of innovation to fall rather than increase, as [they block] the ability of science to move forward in an open exploratory way”.<sup id="fnref51"><a href="#fn51" rel="footnote">51</a></sup> They often benefit first-movers in retaining their technical advantage through policy instruments. However, as the Tesla/Toyota or Android examples illustrate, moving to open source DPGs alone does not prevent market capture. Still, the issue of ownership is important as knowledge-building through playgrounds involves collaborations, the custody of whose products must be clearly ascertained.
</p>
<p>
The myths identified in <em>The Entrepreneurial State </em>are not merely the outcome of theoretical debates. In so far as they relate to the role of the state and that of large platforms in the economy, they are also  reflected in some entrenched regulatory propositions, which are outlined below.
</p>
<h2 id="prop_1"><strong>Proposition</strong> <strong>1</strong> <a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
<em>Natural monopolies are good as long as they benefit the consumer or end user. Where regulation is required, it is only to prevent vertical monopolisation.</em>
</p>
<p>
Natural monopolies, which develop on account of economies of scale — railroads, telecommunications, electricity etc — are perceived to be benign as long as their presence benefits the consumer through lowered costs. In other words, only if their monopoly profits (increasing returns on continually lower operating costs) were passed on to the consumer. In the United States, antitrust laws passed at the turn of the 19th century permitted natural monopolies,<sup id="fnref52"><a href="#fn52" rel="footnote">52</a></sup> although some were re-ascribed as “common carriers” or “public utilities”, and required to charge reasonable rates for their services. This view, with minor tweaks, has become the mainstay of regulatory thinking not only in the US, but many economies today. The logic of the “rate of return” regulation — allowing the business to obtain a competitive return on capital investments — is that government interventions “cannot alter the monopoly outcome, but only change the form in which monopoly rent is captured”.<sup id="fnref53"><a href="#fn53" rel="footnote">53</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Of course, natural monopolies are not always a foregone conclusion. Platforms that would later become “public utilities” were essentially creatures of patent laws that first permitted the consolidation of technological know-how, and municipal franchises, whose licensing system subsequently entrenched the market dominance of incumbents.<sup id="fnref54"><a href="#fn54" rel="footnote">54</a></sup> The “public utilities” model of regulation was also designed to tackle the horizontal expansion of monopolies (for <em>e.g.</em>, the Interstate Commerce Act in the US, designed to rein in rail road services that had expanded beyond one state). It does not adequately respond to, or address the problems of vertical integration. Vertical integration can lead to anti-competitive practices at the infrastructure and platform level, resulting in the stymieing of innovation, barriers to market access for smaller participants, highly discriminatory labour practices, and eventually a distortion of consumer choice. All while perpetuating the monopolistic position of the incumbent. For e.g,. 44 cents of every dollar spent by Americans reportedly goes to Amazon<sup id="fnref55"><a href="#fn55" rel="footnote">55</a></sup>-- and that was long before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic -- which is only possible on account of its “cradle-to-grave” capture of the supply chain and the platform on which products/services are sold.
</p>
<p>
To address these problems, recent scholarship has called for the “structural separation” of infrastructure, platforms and services, not unlike the way in which communications and banking has been regulated in North America and Western Europe.<sup id="fnref56"><a href="#fn56" rel="footnote">56</a></sup> In “street” parlance, structural separation is nothing but the breaking up of Big Tech. But even this proposition — “structural separation enhances consumer welfare” — is problematic in the context of emerging markets like India for three reasons:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Regulatory capacity - unfortunately, most regulatory agencies in emerging markets do not have the powers or resources to enforce irreversible measures like ‘structural segregation’. If the Microsoft case is any indication, attempts to break up monopolies have to be backed by strong legislative mandates for regulators, combined with a political will for extended litigation. In developing countries, especially new democracies, both are often wanting. 
</li>

<li>Segregation of vertical monopolies could be described as an extreme solution to an admittedly serious problem. As one report highlights using examples from the technology sector, such monopolies — no matter how powerful at any given moment — can also be ephemeral, and upended by innovative upstarts.<sup id="fnref57"><a href="#fn57" rel="footnote">57</a></sup> Segregation further minimizes the possibility (if at all) of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”, identified earlier in this chapter: as long as platforms are open and interoperable, the challengers to the incumbent themselves emerge by disrupting the established supply chain in its totality (alternative sources of raw material, newer markets, by breaking through faster cycles of disruption in any segment of the vertically tied market, etc).<sup id="fnref58"><a href="#fn58" rel="footnote">58</a></sup>

<li>Aim for interoperability, not segregation — The history of technology standards and protocols suggest that innovations often come from outside the small circle of market leaders and their satellites (for e.g., the Chrome protocol, developed by Google when Microsoft's Internet Explorer was the dominant, has cornered the lion’s share of the market). Interoperability is a key determinant to the success of protocols, since they are agnostic of platforms and infrastructure, and easily adopted by the  market. A structurally segregated market has few incentive to pursue interoperable standards because mobility up and down the vertical is limited.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prop_2"><strong>Proposition 2</strong><a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
<em>The state should only support or guide the private sector in its provision of public goods, not produce them itself. </em>
</p>
<p>
The inefficiencies inherent in the provision of public goods — free-riding, market failures leading to exclusion, etc — have been identified in this paper. But prescriptions to the problem have largely remained modest. Most economists and planners believe the private sector is still best placed to provide public goods, with the help of an enabling regulatory framework from the state. This framework may include taxing of positive externalities from the public good, or subsidies to incentivise its provision. In other cases, the sub-optimal production of public goods may be resolved, the argument goes, by clearly delineating property rights. In all these instances, the state is seen as guiding the “invisible hand” of the market, as a regulator or enforcer. Indeed, save issues such as national security, law enforcement, or international cooperation, it is rarely the case that the state is mooted as an ideal supplier of public goods. A more nuanced view from social scientists (mostly from classical liberals) is that the provision of public goods is aided by the building of capacity by the state at the unit level, i.e. the individual or the community, but this is not often a scalable result.<sup id="fnref59"><a href="#fn59" rel="footnote">59</a></sup> In fact, that may well be the intention. “Government as an investor will have to find a way to be anti-scale. […] It avoids the slowness and bureaucracy of direct government provision of services, although efficient government units can certainly compete. It recognizes that citizens are quicker and more creative at responding to change and coming up with new solutions,” writes Anne-Marie Slaughter.<sup id="fnref60"><a href="#fn60" rel="footnote">60</a></sup> Libertarian approaches (including “state capacity libertarians”) to public goods tend to focus on policy that rewards markets for innovation, not on the government’s efforts to improve human capacity.<sup id="fnref61"><a href="#fn61" rel="footnote">61</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state is considered to be an inefficient provider of public goods on account of many reasons: the rent-seeking behaviour of governments, self-perpetuation of bureaucracies, and as mentioned above, lack of agility in its decision-making processes. More recent scholarship points to public-private partnerships as a <em>modus vivendi</em>, where private provision and operation is backed by government stewardship of the public good.<sup id="fnref62"><a href="#fn62" rel="footnote">62</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, in societies where there exists a trust deficit between the citizenry and the private sector, especially foreign corporations (on account of colonial legacies, past predatory practices etc), it is important for the state to play an active role in creating the public good or guiding its use. This is all the more relevant for digital public goods, whose introduction in emerging markets will be met with hostility or suspicion. Technology-based public goods have to be incubated by the state, or needs its imprimatur of authority, because the private sector may not be able to secure by itself the adoption of DPGs by the citizenry. 
</p>
<h2 id="prop_3"><strong>Proposition 3<em> </em></strong><a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
<em>Industrial policies for technology are not necessary as long as value chains are competitive and free from capture by any single market player. </em>
</p>
<p>
Since the end of the Cold War, the mainstream embrace of industrial policies has been lukewarm at best. Although Western Europe and East Asia famously developed on the back of industrial policies — Latin America had less success — they receded into the background after the command-and-control economies of the Soviet Union and in its “sphere of influence” bit the dust.  (Incidentally, even the US was seriously debating industrial policy in the 80s before ‘Reaganomics’ cast aside any prospects of that in favour of deregulated markets.<sup id="fnref63"><a href="#fn63" rel="footnote">63</a></sup>) Even the 2008 global financial crisis has not been able to shake off the perception that the market can incubate industry and enterprise, as long as fair practices are enforced by the state.  
</p>
<p>
Rather than subsidise exports or create “national champions”, one argument goes, the economy is better-served by creating technology clusters where the supply chains are competitive and not prone to capture by any single entity.<sup id="fnref64"><a href="#fn64" rel="footnote">64</a></sup> According to this view, clusters promote entrepreneurship and through competition, drive up wages and encourage competitive innovation. They may create positive spillovers by creating an impetus for complementary industrial activity and even promote/ sustain knowledge production around them (for e.g. Stanford in Silicon Valley, or MIT in Boston).<sup id="fnref65"><a href="#fn65" rel="footnote">65</a></sup> As long as the same incentives are offered to everyone in the group or cluster, the assumption remains that resultant gains are evenly (or equitably) distributed. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
However, the history of such industrial clusters indicates that value is invariably captured by one or a handful of actors, who gain a monopolistic hold over the entire supply chain. This is true of Western Europe (for e.g. the steel and aeronautics industries); East Asia (chaebols in South Korea); and Silicon Valley (the dominance of FAANG). On the other hand, in ecosystems like the Route 128 corridor in Boston, the imposition of market-based barriers to monopolistic control — non-disclosure agreements — led to its stagnation.<sup id="fnref66"><a href="#fn66" rel="footnote">66</a></sup> And in a “winner takes all” system, not only do the gains of smaller, affiliated corporations, but also their continued survival, become tethered to the entity capturing most value from the business. Even China, the most recent and visibly successful proponent of clustered industries, does not seem to have been able to break out of the value capture trap in the case of technology. A World Bank-funded paper argues the goal of industrial policies is to create “general purpose technologies” but they are “rarely attained” in “low innovation-intensity developing countries”.<sup id="fnref67"><a href="#fn67" rel="footnote">67</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The explosive growth of IT-enabled services in many parts of the developing world — which speaks to in-house talent and resources — and the increasing affordability of electronics arguably increases the likelihood of such “rare” events. Many emerging markets have turned to address problems of governance through digital technologies (notably through ID programmes) after their IT sector has attained some degree of maturation. India has led by example on this count. However, to ensure the DPGs so developed do not lead to value capture by one or few actors, sector-specific playground rules may perhaps be needed. This issue is revisited in the following segment, and detailed in the second working paper of this series for India’s credit and health playgrounds.  
</p>
<p>
A common set of questions animate the discussion in this segment, as well as the regulatory propositions listed above: Who provides the digital public good? If the DPG is supplied by the private sector, what is the role of the state in designing the rules of its use? And finally, how can playgrounds be designed to prevent the capture of a DPG by a single/ set of actors? These are great ponderables, but ones that require urgent solutions. The following section identifies the online travel industry as a case study of flawed playground design: it traces the history and evolution of the playground, highlighting why the provision of digital public goods, and their insulation from capture by special interests matter to all stakeholders.

<p>
<em>“The Internet is the worst thing that could ever happen to the airline industry. It's going to allow for total transparency on our prices, it's going to allow the stupidest customer to control the pricing to the consumer when we can't even control it to the travel agents, let alone to the consumer.”</em>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Robert Crendall, former CEO of American Airlines, to Jay Walker, founder of Priceline (1997)<sup id="fnref68"><a href="#fn68" rel="footnote">68</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
The birth and evolution of the online travel industry since the early 1990s is instructive to policymakers who design digital playgrounds, and entrepreneurs who seek to participate in them. Far from disrupting the airline industry, as Mr. Crendall predicted in 1997, the internet largely served to entrench the interests of incumbents for decades. Legacy decisions that limited the expansion of this playground to smaller actors have ironically opened the door for Big Tech -- Forbes magazine recently termed Google the “biggest travel company”<sup id="fnref69"><a href="#fn69" rel="footnote">69</a></sup> -- whose growth has come at the expense of “online travel agents” (OTAs) like Expedia and Priceline. In other words, one set of powerful actors are being replaced by a newer, equally powerful group, and the customer, for whom the internet was heralded as an equaliser, only has the illusion of choice. The marginalisation of OTAs by Big Tech platforms will almost certainly be precipitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has forced a squeeze on the latter’s revenues.<sup id="fnref70"><a href="#fn70" rel="footnote">70</a></sup> What does this “playground” offer as lessons for Indian regulators and businesses?       
</p>
<p>
The technology “playground” for air travel, which has since grown to encompass the travel and hospitality sectors, has essentially evolved around two Global Distribution Systems (GDS), Sabre and Amadeus. GDS serve as the intermediary between travel agents and airlines, fetching information via electronic networks about the availability of routes, and their fares. The development of GDS services has mirrored the Boeing-Airbus split between North America and Europe. After many mergers and consolidations, there exist all but three GDS platforms in the world today: Sabre, which was developed by American Airlines in the 1950s, and has since spun off into an independent company; Amadeus, created as Sabre’s European rival by Lufthansa and other major EU carriers, and is also a separate holding entity today; and Travelport, which acquired the GDS formerly known as Galileo. Between themselves, Sabre and Amadeus have cornered nearly 80% of the air travel market.<sup id="fnref71"><a href="#fn71" rel="footnote">71</a></sup> Airlines enter into long-term agreements with GDS platforms to make their routes and fares available on the latter in exchange for a fee. GDS platforms, on the other hand, offer travel agents financial incentives (best rates, discounts, etc) to continue using their services. 
</p>
<p>
To be sure, GDS platforms were never designed as open and interoperable ‘digital public goods’. For instance, when Sabre was spun-off from American Airlines at the height of the dot-com boom, it was with the intention of creating a for-profit company (say, unlike the National Payments Corporation of India, that is the custodian of the UPI).<sup id="fnref72"><a href="#fn72" rel="footnote">72</a></sup> The GDS system evidently concentrated power in a few intermediaries, and the lopsidedness of the playground was exacerbated by economies of scale in the airlines industry, which limited the number of carriers in the market. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, GDS platforms have been highly resistant to change. By all accounts, they run on legacy infrastructure and interfaces that have long outlasted their utility.<sup id="fnref73"><a href="#fn73" rel="footnote">73</a></sup> There also seems to be little movement towards equitable contracts between travel agencies and GDS companies.<sup id="fnref74"><a href="#fn74" rel="footnote">74</a></sup> The internet, by democratising access to information, was expected to distribute gains and losses more evenly among all players in this sector. Contrary to such expectations, GDS platforms further consolidated power in the digital age, and expanded their reach to other sectors such as hospitality.<sup id="fnref75"><a href="#fn75" rel="footnote">75</a></sup> The case serves as a reminder that the mere presence of actors with varying/ competing business interests -- the <em>raison d’etre </em>of the “invisible hand”--  cannot alone ensure the efficient provision of a “digital public good”. Instead, the configuration of rights and responsibilities of actors who provide the DPG also matter significantly. Simply put, the architecture of the playground is as important as the digital public good it supplies.
</p>
<p>
The following are some lessons that may be absorbed by Indian policymakers from the evolution of the “playground” for online travel. 
</p>
<h2 id="need_for_effective"><strong><em>Need for effective regulation</em></strong><a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
From the outset, GDS platforms were joined at the hip with airlines whose tickets were being sold through their networks. Air carriers that owned stakes in GDS platforms tried initially to suppress search results from their competitors, creating a blatantly anti-competitive environment. In 1984, the United States Civil Aeronautics Board issued regulations prohibiting “search bias” and “discriminatory booking fees” through GDS platforms.<sup id="fnref76"><a href="#fn76" rel="footnote">76</a></sup> This did not, however, create a level-playing field, because the airline industry itself had been deregulated a few years before and struggled with price wars and intense competition from upstarts. Their desperation to tap more markets and reach new constituencies made airlines lean ever more on GDS platforms, whose goal was profit-making, just like another company. The lesson here for India is that regulatory action must be holistic: the proverbial right hand must know what the left hand is doing. Playgrounds in healthcare or fintech cannot be built without assessing or re-aligning the underlying economic incentives of key participants (hospitals, banks, underwriters, insurance companies etc) in that same playground. Merely offering digital infrastructure that connects these actors is not enough, because -- as the history of online travel in the US shows -- it can lead to further concentration of economic power.
</p>
<h2 id="interoperability"><strong><em>Interoperability</em></strong><a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
Since GDS platforms emerged from competing airlines, there was never any effort to build interoperable architecture. Far from designing common standards, playground participants further fragmented them through artificial barriers. As the US Department of Justice recently acknowledged: 
</p>
<p>

    <em>“Traditional travel agencies cannot readily switch between GDSs because of contractual and technical restrictions. A traditional agency typically enters into a long-term contract with a GDS that includes financial incentives committing the agency to book through that GDS and penalizing the agency for shifting bookings to alternative channels.”</em><sup id="fnref77"><a href="#fn77" rel="footnote">77</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Airlines, on the other hand, have had to engage all GDS platforms to ensure maximum outreach. The lack of interoperability proved detrimental as traditional business in this sector moved to the internet. By the mid-80s, American Airlines had already developed its own direct-to-customer platform called eAAsySabre -- widely considered the precursor to the modern, online travel agency. However, few airlines wanted to join this venture, seeing as the underlying infrastructure was owned by their competitor. A decade later, when the dot-com boom took off, Expedia was incubated within Microsoft, while American Airlines transformed eAAsySabre into Travelocity. Rather than leveraging the internet to pool their resources -- and thus potentially reducing costs and expanding market access -- existing actors in the playground saw the digital medium as an extension of their traditional business models. In fact, Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates reportedly sounded out Bob Crendall on a joint venture where “Microsoft would do the front end, and Sabre would do the back end”.<sup id="fnref78"><a href="#fn78" rel="footnote">78</a></sup> However, the plan fell through because “both [companies] wanted to drive the car”<sup id="fnref79"><a href="#fn79" rel="footnote">79</a></sup>, <em>i.e.</em>, steer the initiative. Microsoft eventually collaborated with Worldspan (now part of Travelport), while Travelocity piggybacked on Sabre. In response to Expedia’s growth, a group of airlines came together to launch their own platform, Orbitz in 2001. Thus, the fragmentation of this digital playground reflected the exact divisions offline.
</p>
<p>
This case offers valuable insight on the ownership and supply of DPGs in a playground. Sectors such as healthcare, transport and education have no meaningful digital “plumbing” in India connecting or serving the various actors involved. The first phase of playground-building -- iSpirt has often referred to it as “Wave 0” -- will invariably involve big private corporations whose adoption of the platform or DPG is crucial to its scalability. This is a sensitive moment for the ecosystem, as bigger actors can easily corner multiple rungs of the playground, or worse, foist their own platforms as the public good in question. Either scenario will be fatal to the interoperability of the DPG. Regulators and policymakers must evaluate the merits of joint playground-building on a case-to-case basis: in some instances, it may make sense for the government to be the steward of the DPG, while in others, it can be hosted and serviced by a non-profit consortium that brings together private and public agencies.
</p>
<h2 id="meaningful_delineation"><strong><em>Meaningful delineation of roles and responsibilities</em></strong><a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
Once the playground itself concentrated around a few players or groups of players, the market for online travel basically became one of mergers and acquisitions. As mentioned above, GDS entities themselves were eventually spun out as independent companies from their parent airlines, but that did little to even the playing field. If the dot-com boom was expected to give rise to hundreds of start-ups democratising the online travel sector, nothing of the sort happened. Not only did the tech bubble burst in 2000, but the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened soon after, dealing a serious blow to the airlines industry. InterActiveCorp, the holding company, announced its acquisition of Expedia just months before 9/11, and embarked on a buying spree, gobbling up Hotels.com, Travelscape, TripAdvisor and Trivago in the process.<sup id="fnref80"><a href="#fn80" rel="footnote">80</a></sup> IAC, through Expedia, also acquired competitors Orbitz and Travelocity in 2015. Priceline, which would later become Booking Holdings Inc, acquired Booking.com, Agoda and Kayak, among others. In short, all aspects of the playground, from booking to reviews, are either owned or controlled by a handful of actors.<sup id="fnref81"><a href="#fn81" rel="footnote">81</a></sup> Given that most online search portals for tickets are owned either by Expedia or Priceline/Booking Holdings Inc, the bevy of “best fare options” available for a customer merely presents an illusion of choice. In effect, the travel “playground” became beholden to value chain “landlords”, as it were, who stood to gain no matter what the transaction was, or who the transacting parties were. 
</p>
<p>
The consolidation of actors in this playground offers yet another lesson for Indian policymakers: regulation should meaningfully distinguish the specific roles of participants within a playground, and not place its faith on antitrust principles to prevent vertical integration. Value capture in a playground can occur in two ways: 1) through the bundling/ integration of products by the same entity and 2) the concentration of power in seemingly unbundled products, who become <em>de facto</em> curators of the playground itself. 
</p>
<p>
The first is a straightforward proposition, but one with no easy answers. The bundling of products by the same firm has been the subject of modern antitrust debate ever since the browser wars of the nineties. In that case, the US government prohibited “exclusive” licensing restrictions Microsoft had placed on PC manufacturers, which prevented them from engaging other Operating Systems/ software developers.<sup id="fnref82"><a href="#fn82" rel="footnote">82</a></sup> Two decades later, Windows still controls the lion’s share of the OS market, highlighting the weaknesses of complex antitrust litigation.
</p>
<p>
Bunding of value can also take place through M&As, as with the case of the online travel sector. This phenomenon too is no stranger to antitrust law. In 2010, Google acquired ITA Software, which had previously been deployed by Orbitz and other players for their search engine functions. The US government vetted and approved the acquisition, merely requiring the continued licensing of ITA by Google to other companies -- in other words, it deployed the “Microsoft principle”.<sup id="fnref83"><a href="#fn83" rel="footnote">83</a></sup> That decision has proved singularly consequential in Google’s rise through the travel and hospitality sector. ITA provided the search engine architecture for many playground participants, and should have been ring-fenced from acquisition to foster innovation.  M&As in the United States have long been vetted for their potential to “harm” innovation, but acquisitions by incumbents of fledgling competitors continue unabated -- the latest being the (now cancelled) acquisition of Farelogix, a direct-to-travel agents service for airlines and hotels, by the GDS Sabre.<sup id="fnref84"><a href="#fn84" rel="footnote">84</a></sup> Rules for access to markets, platforms and capital within a playground are all decisions that must be evaluated <em>apriori</em> by policymakers at the stage of its design. In some playgrounds, mission-critical technologies may well have to be protected from any form of predatory acquisition.
</p>
<p>
The second scenario is value capture by independent companies who offer seemingly unbundled products. The creation of “Wintels” -- Windows OS running on Intel processors -- is still under-discussed as a policy issue. Individually, the monopolistic positions of Microsoft and Intel in their respective markets has been extensively litigated. But they thrive on mutual reliance, and despite premature assessments of its “break-up”,<sup id="fnref85"><a href="#fn85" rel="footnote">85</a></sup> their alliance has progressively strengthened over the years. Both companies are independent entities, owned and governed by different corporate structures. Current rules of the “playground” require only the vetting of their antitrust potential as individual businesses. But it is virtually impossible for other actors in the playground of “personal computing” to generate value outside of this alliance, by straying away from the supply chain this conjoint ecosystem has created. Antitrust policy is therefore rendered meaningless. Value, where generated, will be marginal and self-sustaining to the centrality of “Wintel” as the <em>de facto </em>curator of this playground. Participants in a playground must not be in a “hub-and-spoke” relationship with one key actor or set of actors, who is able to charge the equivalent of “shelving fees” (to borrow an analogy from the e-commerce industry) to keep their respective products in circulation.
</p>
<p>
In an ideal playground, every actor will be considered dispensable, and their absence will be swiftly addressed by the emergence of an upstart. The moment value generation becomes concentrated in different rungs, as it did with the GDS platforms in online travel or Wintel in computing, they will either become permanent and monopolistic fixtures that can steer the course of the playground itself. Alternatively, such value concentration may also make the playground an easy target for Big Tech to acquire its creators, as the examples of Google in online travel and Amazon in publishing suggest.The lesson here is that ring fencing mission-critical sectors (at the time of playground design) may not alone be enough. Even B2B rules of conduct or relationships have to be clearly delineated in a playground. 
</p>
<h2 id="Unified_payment"><em>Unified Payments Interface</em><a href="#contents">&#8617;</a></h2>


<p>
India has sought to operationalise the aforementioned principles -- a 360-degree view of regulation, interoperability, and meaningful delineation of playground participant roles -- in the case of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). As described earlier, UPI is a DPG that “supplies” financial inclusion. However, this public good can be part of multiple playgrounds, including for cash transfers, lending and health insurance. In a December 2019 report, the Bank of International Settlements took note of UPI’s interoperability, arguing “its open API architecture [not only] enables individuals to use a single bank or payment service application to manage their money residing in multiple banks, [but also] ensures greater competition on bank interest rates and services.”<sup id="fnref86"><a href="#fn86" rel="footnote">86</a></sup> Its interoperability has been crucial to UPI’s extraordinary growth and adoption in India, clocking over 10 billion transactions at the end of 2019.<sup id="fnref87"><a href="#fn87" rel="footnote">87</a></sup> Today, this DPG is used by 143 banks across the country.<sup id="fnref88"><a href="#fn88" rel="footnote">88</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
But do UPI-centric playgrounds meaningfully delineate the roles of its participants? UPI itself is hosted within the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which is a not-for-profit collective of major banks, with ten “core promoters”. However, the use and deployment of this DPG is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. (That the NPCI was established with the help of the RBI admittedly leads to concerns that the government has sought to become curator and participant in UPI-centric playgrounds.) NPCI’s stewardship of UPI is by no means a guarantee that its core promoters or powerful members can influence the design of UPI-based playgrounds. In January 2019, addressing the emergence of “new retail payment systems”, the RBI sought to “minimise” the concentration of tasks and power in a “single entity”, i.e., the NPCI.<sup id="fnref89"><a href="#fn89" rel="footnote">89</a></sup> In its note, the RBI asked whether the payment systems managed by a single operator, such as UPI, should give way to “multiple systems with similar product features offered by different operators”. The RBI offered this proposal with a view to limiting monopolistic practices, arguing they could pose a risk to “economic efficiency” and “innovation”. The central bank’s proposal has not been implemented, but reflects the view that playgrounds have no indispensable actor -- include the steward of the DPG -- that controls or captures value disproportionately. 
</p>
<p>
Also part of UPI playgrounds are Account Aggregators (which act as fiduciaries of data for users), credit bureaus, loan service providers and underwriter modellers. Account Aggregators are considered public utilities, while others are subject to varying degrees of regulation (for e.g., profits are capped for credit bureaus, while they are not for loan service providers). No aspect of the playground is insulated from competition or disruption. In the United States, for <em>e.g.</em>, tens of credit bureaus exist, but the market has been dominated for long by the Big Three: TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. The trio enjoy operating margins as high as 25%, thanks to their control over consumer data.<sup id="fnref90"><a href="#fn90" rel="footnote">90</a></sup>  In India, on the other hand, the RBI has recently pushed for the creation of alternatives (a “public credit registry”) to incumbents such as CIBIL.<sup id="fnref91"><a href="#fn91" rel="footnote">91</a></sup> Such proposed disruption is possible not only on account of UPI’s interoperability, which invites more actors to the playground, but also the playground design itself. The playground’s data sharing framework seeks to meaningfully separate the powers of those who hold financial data and rate consumer credit respectively, thereby preventing monopolistic tendencies. UPI-driven playgrounds in India are far from perfect -- as they mature, new policy considerations will invariably arise, which need to be accounted for. The UPI/Yes Bank/PhonePe scenario detailed in this paper is one instance of how concentration of functions at one rung can lead to negative consequences in another, downstream rung. Nevertheless, these playgrounds have sought to operationalise principles and philosophies identified in this paper, and will likely offer a template for DPG-centric playgrounds in other sectors as well.

What’s more, UPI playgrounds not only govern the relationship between the mission-critical DPG and playground participants (public and private), but also lay down rules for B2B interactions among the private sector. Currently, these are crafted as “UPI Procedural guidelines” by the NPCI.<sup id="fnref92"><a href="#fn92" rel="footnote">92</a></sup> For e.g., a payment service provider’s app should be accessible to all bank customers. The security of transactions “between the mobile handset and the bank’s server” is the responsibility of the remitting and beneficiary PSP. These rules effectively “unbundle” the playground by delineating the functional responsibilities of its participants, both in relation to the DPG as well as arrangements between themselves. This is done so that value capture does not happen at the secondary or tertiary levels of the playground.

<p>
The case study of the online travel “playground” has been offered to reinforce some of the propositions presented in this paper. The ownership and management of digital public goods, as well as the orchestration of the playground, matter enormously if both are to have a societal impact. As its traditional sectors move towards digitalized playgrounds, it is important for India to frame its own regulatory templates, and not blindly absorb those enacted in the United States or Europe decades ago. Even advanced economies have attempted to move away or amend their antitrust framework in recent years, but decisions taken in the past often suffer from “path dependency”. That the same template has been used to evaluate the Microsoft settlement in 2001, Google’s acquisition of ITA Software in 2010 and Sabre’s attempted acquisition of Farelogix in 2019 reflects the increasing cost of straying from a well-worn policy path. Calls to “break up” Big Tech reflect, in some ways, the paucity of options available to regulators in creating sustainable technology playgrounds. Such threats are also unlikely to be followed through, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19, which has seen a rise in the profiles of Silicon Valley companies. The same frenzy of M&As that followed the burst of the dot-com bubble and 9/11 could be repeated after the pandemic. India and other emerging economies must ensure that their regulatory principles reflect societal considerations, and not market factors alone. Interoperable protocols and technical standards will ensure all playground participants have equitable access to DPGs. Profiteering from the ownership/stewardship of the DPGs -- to be differentiated from profit-making in the actual playground -- must be strictly prohibited, if playground building has to be sustainable.  The rules of engagement between private businesses in a playground, such as the UPI Procedural Guidelines, are just as important as the governance of the DPG itself. Equally critical is whether venture capital in India will reorient itself towards picking winners for playgrounds, not based on their user engagement metrics, but their proposed innovation to the use of Digital Public Good. Ultimately, the policy measures identified in this paper as ingredients for the effective provision of DPGs can only be realised if the underlying playground is conceived and designed with active collaboration from the private sector as well as not-for-profit organisations with domain expertise.
